This project explores the SIR model (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) to simulate infectious disease spread using ordinary differential equations (ODEs). 
Students will apply numerical methods, interpolation, data fitting, and Fourier analysis to understand epidemic dynamics and inform public health decisions. 
The project bridges theory and practice, equipping students to tackle interdisciplinary challenges in science and engineering.
Key topics include solving ODEs, interpolation, least squares, and Fourier analysis.
